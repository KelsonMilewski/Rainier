				<h1><i>Crested Geckos</i></h1>

				<h2><u><b>Housing</b></u></h2>
				<p>You should use a minimum of a 20GL tall tank is satisfactory for an adult crested gecko a more spacious tank is more desirable. Crested geckos are arboreal and require a lot of vertical space for climbing a taller tank is the best. If you have multiple crested geckos only keep one male per tank. Implement a mix of branches, driftwood, vines, and cork bark throughout the tank. Add lots of foliage (live or plastic) they will use the plants for hiding. A water dish is not needed as they will drink droplets of water from the tank.</p>

	 			<h2><u><b>Substrate</b></u></h2>
	 			<p>Crested geckos spend a majority of their time above the ground so you can use a variety of substrates. Use a substrate that holds moisture such as coco fiber or moss. Paper towels are recommended for juveniles as they are more prone to swallow other substrates while hunting.</p>

 				<h2><u><b>Temperature</b></u></h2>
 				<p>Temperature for a crested gecko should be kept within 70 and 78 degrees. If the temperature is 82 degrees or higher your crested gecko will become stressed, which could lead to sickness or is some instances death.</p>

		 		<h2><u><b>Humidity</b></u></h2>
		 		<p>Crested geckos require a medium to high humidity level preferably 60 to 80 percent humidity use a hygrometer to guarantee you have the correct humidity. Mist the tank with water to maintain humidity depending on your tank you may need to mist it a few times a day to retain humidity. Assure sure the cage is well misted in the evening as crested geckos are most active at night.</p>

				<h2><u><b>Food</b></u></h2>
			 	<p>Crested Geckos feed on both fruit and insects in nature. Repashy, as well as Pangea fruit mixes, are most preferred among crested gecko owners. They can also be fed crickets or Dubai roaches as a portion of their diet. If you feed insects they should be dusted with a vitamin and mineral powder.</p>

				<br/>
				<h1><i>Leopard Geckos</i></h1>

				<h2><u><b> Housing</b></u></h2>
				<p>A 15 to 20GL tank should be a good size for a leopard gecko. Make sure to provide a hiding place both dry and damp. A fish tank could work aswell for leopard geckos. A normal white light incandescent heat bulb could be used to provide a basking spot.</p>

				<h2><u><b>Substrate</b></u></h2>
				<p>For smaller leopard geckos, enclosure carpet or paper towels will work well. For older geckos, you could use enclosure carpet, paper towels, or fine reptile sand that can be used to provide the leopard gecko with a more natural setting.</p>

				<h2><u><b>Temperature</b></u></h2>
				<p> Temperature for a leopard gecko basking spot should 88 to 75 degrees. At night the temperature should be around  70 to 75 degrees. Leopard geckos do not need very humid environments, but if the humidity is under 20% you may notice that your gecko has difficulty shedding.</p>

				<h2><u><b>Food</b></u></h2>
				<p>A shallow dish of water should be given at all times for your leopard gecko. You should feed a variety of crickets, waxworms, mealworms. Insects need to be gut loaded for at least 24 hours before feeding and then covered with a calcium supplement at each feeding. Younger geckos should be fed a few crickets every day, older geckos can skip several days between meals.</p>

				<br/><br/>
				<h1><i>Isopods</i></h1>

				<h2><u><b>Housing</b></u></h2>
				<p> Plastic boxes with lids are preferred to keep humidity. However, if the top is not vented, the container should be regularly opened. Compressed bedding or mulch works well as a bottom layer in the container. Provide some type of material for the isopods to hide under. They should be kept in a slightly moist enclosure at room temperature.</p>

				<h2><u><b>Watering</b></u></h2>
				<p>Provide a water dish with wet paper towels or cotton balls. Too much standing water will cause them to drown. Use a spray bottle to mist the culture periodically.</p>

				<h2><u><b>Feeding</b></u></h2>
				<p>Feeding your isopods is relatively easy but you need the right food or they will not be strong enough to propagate. You can feed them Lettuce, Carrot , Cucumber, or Squash.</p>

				<br/>
				<h1><i>SpringTails</i></h1>

				<h2><u><b>Housing</b></u></h2>
				<p>Using a plastic container with lid ventilation is not required. For the substrate, use a layer of charcoal (horticultural or activated charcoal) with less than an inch of standing water on the bottom. Keep at room temperature and occasionally open the lid for air exchange. </p>

				<h2><u><b>Feeding</b></u></h2>
				<p>Drop in a few grains of rice into your culture. Rice will mold over and will provide a reliable food source. Exchange the old rice with new grains if they have lost interest in the older rice.</p>

				<br/>
				<h1><i>Adding Critters To Your Setup</i></h1>

				<h2><u><b>Basic Information</b></u></h2>
				<p> Provide the culture a week or two to develop before pulling from it. Do not transfer your whole culture into your setup if you plan on reproducing them. If you want to get started with a bioactive setup we offer clean up crews in our store.</p>
