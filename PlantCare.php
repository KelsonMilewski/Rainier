				<h1><i>Carnivorous Plants </i></h1>

				<h2><u><b> Watering </b></u></h2>
				<p>Do not use tap water or mineral water on carnivorous plants. Rainwater or distilled water is ideal. Most carnivorous plants require moist to wet soil in the warmer months and less moisture in winter.</p>

	 			<h2><u><b> Light </b></u></h2>
	 			<p>All carnivorous plants need bright light. They will not produce carnivorous traps unless in a bright windowsill, under artificial light, or outdoors in direct sunlight. </p>

 				<h2><u><b> Soil </b></u></h2>
 				<p>Garden soil is not suitable for carnivorous plants. The preferred media for most are live sphagnum moss, dried long-fiber sphagnum moss or a mix of about three parts peat moss to one part clean sand.</p>

		 		<h2><u><b> Humidity </b></u></h2>
		 		<p>Most carnivorous plants need high humidity. An indoor terrarium or an outdoor garden in humid areas will satisfy this need.</p>

				<h1><i>Forest Terrariums</i></h1>

				<h2><u><b> Watering </b></u></h2>
				<p><b>Open Terrariums</b> - Pour water directly into the soil to make the soil very moist typically once every 7-14 days depending on the season and climate. Don't let open terrariums dry out completely.</p>

			 	<p><b>Closed Terrariums</b> - require little watering, check if the soil is moist. When in doubt, it is always better to not water than to give too much.</p>

			 	<h2><u><b> Light </b></u></h2>
			 	<p>Certain plants need bright, but indirect light. Never place in direct sunlight or outdoors.</p>
				
				<br/>
				<h1><i>Succulent Terrariums</i></h1>

			 	<h2><u><b> Watering </b></u></h2>
			 	<p>Succulent terrariums do require watering. You can spray with a small mist every week. Let the soil dry out between watering.</p>

				<h2><u><b> Light </b></u></h2>
				<p>Succulents like lots of indirect light. Never put in direct sunlight or outdoors. They do well on a window that gets indirect light all day. Too much direct sunlight will cook the plants.</p>
